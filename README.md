## About this App

The premise about this app centered around safety. Users would log their experiences and thoughts about the safety of the cities they've visited so that other users who plan on visiting those cities could aware of what they are getting themselves into. Safety is sometimes an overlooked aspect when planning a trip. Although user experiences differ greatly, hopefully this app will provide users a better perspective on their desired destinations.

## Approach Taken

1. The approach to make this app with simple CRUD function was with Ruby on Rails. Technologies used was the command line, ruby gems, Google Chrome, and Atom.

## Technologies used

Safe Travels uses Ruby on Rails for functionality and design. HTML and CSS are used to style the web app. And lastly, JQuery is used on the star rating system. https://designapp.io/ was used to create the logo/background.

## Issues

1. One of the biggest issues was incorporating the RatyRate gem and utilizing it's star rating functionality. Ultimately, I decided to not use this gem.

## Deliverables

1. MVP: 2 models: Cities and Ratings. CRUD functionality.

2. Bronze: Devise/User. Style to window. Icon/Logo.

3. Silver: Star rating system. Comments section to ratings.

4. Gold: Organize, sort, and search cites < countries < continents. A map?

## User Stories

1. As a user, I should be able to sign up and make an account.
2. As a user, I should be able to log in and log out.
3. As a user, I should be able to read other country posts and ratings other users has made.
4. As a user, I should be able to create, read, update, and delete my own posts and ratings
5. As a user, I should be able to easily navigate through the web app.
6. As an observer, I should be able to understand where the user is on the web page.
7. As a user, I should be able to rate the cities using the rating star system.
8. As a user and observer, I should be able to easily understand the rating system.
