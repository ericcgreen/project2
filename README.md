## Approach Taken

1. The approach to make this app with simple CRUD function was with Ruby on Rails. Technologies used was the command line, ruby gems, Google Chrome, and Atom.

## Issues

1. One of the biggest issues was incorporating the RatyRate gem and utilizing it's star rating functionality. Ultimately, I decided to not use this gem.

## Deliverables

1. MVP: 2 models: Cities and Ratings. CRUD functionality.

2. Bronze: Devise/User. Style to window. Icon/Logo.

3. Silver: Star rating system. Comments section to ratings.

4. Gold: Organize, sort, and search cites < countries < continents. A map?

## User Stories

1. As a user, I should be able to sign up and make an account.
2. As a user, I should be able to log in and log out.
3. As a user, I should be able to read other country posts and ratings other users has made.
4. As a user, I should be able to create, read, update, and delete my own posts and ratings
5. As a user, I should be able to easily navigate through the web app.
6. As an observer, I should be able to understand where the user is on the web page.
7. As a user, I should be able to rate the cities using the rating star system.
8. As a user and observer, I should be able to easily understand the rating system.
